# dtrx

"**Do The Right eXtraction**" - don't remember what set of `tar` flags or where to
pipe the output to extract it? no worries!

TL;DR

```bash
pip install dtrx

dtrx yolo.tar.gz
```

This is a copy-paste of the original dtrx repo, and **all credit for this
software** should be attributed to the original author, Brett Smith @brettcs:

See the original [`README`](README) for more details on what this does!

## Changes in this repo

This repo contains some patches on top of the original source to enable using
`dtrx` with python3. The original motivation was to enable `dtrx` on Ubuntu
20.04+, where the `dtrx` apt package was removed from the default ppas (likely
due to being python2 only).

I attempted to get the tests all working via `tox` , for which I used a
Dockerfile to try to get some kind of environment consistency. You can run the
tests by running (requires Docker installed):

```bash
./test.sh
```

## Development

### Contributions

Contributions are gladly welcomed! Feel free to open a Pull Request with any
changes.

### Issues

When posting an issue, it can be very handy to provide any example files (for
example, the archive that failed to extract) or reproduction steps so we can
address the problem quickly.

### Releases

Releases are tagged in this repo and published to pypi.org. The release process
is the following (unfortunately manual) steps:

```bash
# update the VERSION value in dtrx/dtrx.py, then:
❯ git add dtrx/dtrx.py
❯ git commit  # fill in the commit message

# create an annotated tag for the release. usually good to put a list of new
# commits since the previous tag, for example by listing them with:
# ❯ git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline
❯ git tag -a <version number>

# build the release archives (requires the 'build' package, `pip install build`)
❯ python -m build

# confirm the correct build artifacts were generated
❯ ls dist
dtrx-8.2.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl  dtrx-8.2.2.tar.gz

# upload to pypi.org (requires a user account on the dtrx project)
❯ twine upload dist/*

# optional, but nice to do, create a GitHub Release for the tag. requires
# permissions on the dtrx GitHub repo
❯ gh release create --generate-notes <tag>
```
